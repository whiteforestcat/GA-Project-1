problems to resolve:
1. diagonal movements do not increase scrollDistance and will not scroll screen -- SKIP
2. when going back, player will exit screen while scroll screen backwards -- DONE
3. add background image -- DONE

- meaning separate the scrolling from the player movement into 2 different players

readup on setTimeout() and setInterval() functions -- IMPORTANT
