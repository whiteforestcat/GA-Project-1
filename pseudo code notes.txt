problems to resolve:
1. when going back, player will exit screen while scroll screen backwards -- DONE
2. add background image -- DONE


add second invisible player hidden in the background (initialised at bottom right corner) which will always scroll the screen
- meaning separate the scrolling from the player movement into 2 different players

readup on setTimeout() and setInterval() functions -- IMPORTANT
include ReadME file
